 Key Insights & Findings

* Most Affected Locations: Auckland and Canterbury reported the highest number of thefts, likely due to urban congestion and high vehicle presence.
* Top Vehicle Brands Stolen: Toyota, Trailer, and Nissan were the most targeted brands, potentially due to high resale demand or weaker anti-theft tech.
* Time of Day: The majority of thefts happened between 12 AM – 6 AM, during low vigilance hours.
* Days of the Week: Slight increases were noted on weekends, indicating less monitoring or more overnight parking.
* Vehicle Types: Stationwagons and Saloons were stolen more frequently than other vehicle types.
* Vehicle Colors: White and Silver were the most stolen, possibly because they’re common and easily blend in.
* Seasonal Trends: Theft cases saw a small peak in December, possibly linked to holidays or reduced law enforcement presence.
